										<h2>Mahendra N Mishra</h2>
										<p>MBBS, MD(Pathology), ESHI Diploma<br />
										Transplant Immunologist working at Belfast Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratory.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am an Immunopathologist with special interest in Transplant Immunology and have teaching experience of fourteen years (equivalent to that of Professor of Pathology as per Medical Council of India standards). I have worked in Indian Armed Forces for 26 years of which 17/24 years were as immunopathologist, and pathologist respectively. This was followed by five years as HOD of Transplant Immunology in and one year NHS assignment as Deputy Head of the Tissue-typing laboratory in Belfast, UK. I am keen on interacting with BMT/ Renal / Liver/ Cardiothoracic transplant teams for establishing appropriate protocols and for any query resolution to ensure that the most appropriate organ is transplanted to the most suitable recipient and its follow up for ensuring its maximum survival.</p>

									<h3>Things I Can Do</h3>
									<p>I want to transfer the knowledge and expertise I have acquired in the field of anti HLA antibody detection to Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia.</p>
									<p>Luminex antibody detection requires a great deal of expertise which is often not provided by the application specialist of the vendor providing this test. Prudent use of the knowledge is useful for deciding which sensitized patients are likely to respond to desensitization, number of rounds of immune adsorption/ plasmapheresis on basis of Flow â€“crossmatch. Further, judicious use of luminex based assays requires close correlation of sensitization history, results of a battery of tests to decide if these antibodies are likely to be naturally occurring antibodies or actually pathogenic. In the absence of this technology many patients will receive an allograft which may not be optimal.</p>

									<p> I'm offering the following services</p>

									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-coffee">Consultation on all aspects of solid organ and haemtaopoetic stem cell transplants</li>
										<li class="fa-users">Collaboration and discussion on research and research work</li>
										<li class="fa-user-md">Training of personnel in your laboratory or hospital</li>
										<li class="fa-hospital-o">Support with setting up of equipment in your laboratory or hospital</li>
										<li class="fa-user">A second opinion on Luminex based assays with special reference to Single antigen assays/ flow assays</li>
										<li class="fa-medkit">Setting up of Flow crossmatch and Luminex based evaluation for highly sensitized individuals to decide if a compatible transplant is possible from a donor The number of plasmapheresis or immuneadsorption required for successful transplantation can be determined. This will need a three colour flowcytometer. Luminex assays can be outsourced.</li>

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>Research is a passion with me and this is amply evidenced by the fact that even with one man department, exigencies of military service, limited funds followed and pressures of work in corporate sector I have succeeded in writing thirty papers in last 17 years on a wide spectrum of topics which includes Immunogenetics, Immunology and coagulation. Published papers are mentioned in my list of publications.</p>

									<p>Here is a <a href="/static/files/publications.pdf">link</a> to my publications and here is a link to my profile on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahendra_Mishra3">ResearchGate</a>.</p>
